            For speed purposes, it is actually recommended that you *don't* access the priority queue through this interface, since the JIT can
            (theoretically?) optimize method calls from concrete-types slightly better.

            Enqueue a node to the priority queue.  Lower values are placed in front. Ties are broken by first-in-first-out.
            This queue automatically resizes itself, so there's no concern of the queue becoming 'full'.
