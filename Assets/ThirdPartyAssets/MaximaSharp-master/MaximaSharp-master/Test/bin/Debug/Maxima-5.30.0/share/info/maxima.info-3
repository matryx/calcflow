72.1 Introduction to simplex
============================

`simplex' is a package for linear optimization using the simplex
algorithm.

   Example:

     (%i1) load("simplex")$
     (%i2) minimize_lp(x+y, [3*x+2*y>2, x+4*y>3]);
                       9        7       1
     (%o2)            [--, [y = --, x = -]]

72.2 Functions and Variables for simplex
========================================

 -- Option variable: epsilon_lp
     Default value: `10^-8'

     Epsilon used for numerical computations in `linear_program'.

     See also: `linear_program'.


 -- Function: linear_program (<A>, <b>, <c>)
     `linear_program' is an implementation of the simplex algorithm.
     `linear_program(A, b, c)' computes a vector <x> for which `c.x' is
     minimum possible among vectors for which `A.x = b' and `x >= 0'.
     Argument <A> is a matrix and arguments <b> and <c> are lists.

     `linear_program' returns a list which contains the minimizing
     vector <x> and the minimum value `c.x'. If the problem is not
     bounded, it returns "Problem not bounded!" and if the problem is
     not feasible, it returns "Problem not feasible!".

     To use this function first load the `simplex' package with
     `load(simplex);'.

     Example:

          (%i2) A: matrix([1,1,-1,0], [2,-3,0,-1], [4,-5,0,0])$
          (%i3) b: [1,1,6]$
          (%i4) c: [1,-2,0,0]$
          (%i5) linear_program(A, b, c);
                             13     19        3
          (%o5)            [[--, 4, --, 0], - -]
                             2      2         2

     See also: `minimize_lp', `scale_lp', and `epsilon_lp'.


 -- Function: maximize_lp (<obj>, <cond>, [<pos>])
     Maximizes linear objective function <obj> subject to some linear
     constraints <cond>. See `minimize_lp' for detailed description of
     arguments and return value.

     See also: `minimize_lp'.


 -- Function: minimize_lp (<obj>, <cond>, [<pos>])
     Minimizes a linear objective function <obj> subject to some linear
     constraints <cond>. <cond> a list of linear equations or
     inequalities. In strict inequalities `>' is replaced by `>=' and
     `<' by `<='. The optional argument <pos> is a list of decision
     variables which are assumed to be positive.

     If the minimum exists, `minimize_lp' returns a list which contains
     the minimum value of the objective function and a list of decision
     variable values for which the minimum is attained. If the problem
     is not bounded, `minimize_lp' returns "Problem not bounded!" and
     if the problem is not feasible, it returns "Problem not feasible!".

     The decision variables are not assumed to be nonegative by
     default. If all decision variables are nonegative, set
     `nonegative_lp' to `true'.  If only some of decision variables are
     positive, list them in the optional argument <pos> (note that this
     is more efficient than adding constraints).

     `minimize_lp' uses the simplex algorithm which is implemented in
     maxima `linear_program' function.

     To use this function first load the `simplex' package with
     `load(simplex);'.

     Examples:

          (%i1) minimize_lp(x+y, [3*x+y=0, x+2*y>2]);
                                4       6        2
          (%o1)                [-, [y = -, x = - -]]
                                5       5        5
          (%i2) minimize_lp(x+y, [3*x+y>0, x+2*y>2]), nonegative_lp=true;
          (%o2)                [1, [y = 1, x = 0]]
          (%i3) minimize_lp(x+y, [3*x+y=0, x+2*y>2]), nonegative_lp=true;
          (%o3)                Problem not feasible!
          (%i4) minimize_lp(x+y, [3*x+y>0]);
          (%o4)                Problem not bounded!

     See also: `maximize_lp', `nonegative_lp', `epsilon_lp'.


 -- Option variable: nonegative_lp
     Default value: `false'

     If `nonegative_lp' is true all decision variables to `minimize_lp'
     and `maximize_lp' are assumed to be positive.

     See also: `minimize_lp'.

73.1 Introduction to simplification
===================================

The directory `maxima/share/simplification' contains several scripts
which implement simplification rules and functions, and also some
functions not related to simplification.


File: maxima.info,  Node: Package absimp,  Next: Package facexp,  Prev: Introduction to simplification,  Up: simplification

73.2 Package absimp
===================

The `absimp' package contains pattern-matching rules that extend the
built-in simplification rules for the `abs' and `signum' functions.
`absimp' respects relations established with the built-in `assume'
function and by declarations such as  `modedeclare (m, even, n, odd)'
for even or odd integers.

   `absimp' defines `unitramp' and `unitstep' functions in terms of
`abs' and `signum'.

   `load (absimp)' loads this package.  `demo (absimp)' shows a
demonstration of this package.

   Examples:

     (%i1) load (absimp)$
     (%i2) (abs (x))^2;
                                            2
     (%o2)                                 x
     (%i3) diff (abs (x), x);

73.3 Package facexp
===================

The `facexp' package contains several related  functions that provide
the user with the ability to structure expressions by controlled
expansion.   This capability  is especially  useful when  the expression
contains variables that have physical meaning, because it is  often true
that the most economical form  of such an expression can be  obtained by
fully expanding the expression with respect to those variables, and then
factoring their coefficients.  While it is  true that this  procedure is
not difficult to carry out using standard Maxima  functions, additional
fine-tuning may also  be desirable, and  these finishing touches  can be
more  difficult to  apply.

   The  function `facsum'  and its  related forms provide a convenient
means for controlling the structure  of expressions in this way.
Another function, `collectterms', can be used to add  two or more
expressions that have already been simplified to this form, without
resimplifying the whole expression again.  This function may be useful
when the expressions are very large.

   `load (facexp)' loads this package.  `demo (facexp)' shows a
demonstration of this package.

 -- Function: facsum (<expr>, <arg_1>, ..., <arg_n>)
     Returns  a form  of <expr>  which depends  on the arguments
     <arg_1>, ..., <arg_n>.  The arguments can be any form suitable for
     `ratvars', or they can be lists  of such  forms.  If  the
     arguments  are not  lists, then  the form returned is  fully
     expanded with respect  to the arguments,  and the coefficients of
     the arguments are factored.  These  coefficients are free of the
     arguments, except perhaps in a non-rational sense.

     If any of the arguments are  lists, then all such lists are
     combined into  a  single  list,   and  instead  of  calling
     `factor'   on  the coefficients  of  the  arguments,  `facsum'
     calls  itself   on  these coefficients, using  this newly
     constructed  single list as  the new argument list  for this
     recursive  call.  This  process can  be  repeated to arbitrary
     depth by nesting the desired elements in lists.

     It is possible that one may wish to `facsum' with respect  to more
     complicated subexpressions,  such as  `log (x + y)'.  Such
     arguments are also  permissible.

     Occasionally the user may wish to obtain any of the  above forms
     for expressions which are specified only by their leading
     operators.  For example, one may wish  to `facsum' with respect to
     all  `log''s.  In this situation, one may  include among the
     arguments either  the specific `log''s which are to be treated in
     this way, or  alternatively, either the expression  `operator
     (log)' or `'operator (log)'.   If one  wished to `facsum' the
     expression <expr> with respect to the operators <op_1>, ...,
     <op_n>, one   would  evaluate  `facsum (<expr>, operator (<op_1>,
     ..., <op_n>))'.  The `operator' form may also appear inside list
     arguments.

     In  addition,  the  setting  of  the  switches   `facsum_combine'
     and `nextlayerfactor' may affect the result of `facsum'.


 -- Global variable: nextlayerfactor
     Default value: `false'

     When `nextlayerfactor' is `true', recursive calls  of `facsum' are
     applied  to  the  factors  of  the  factored  form   of  the
     coefficients of the arguments.

     When  `false', `facsum' is applied to each coefficient as a whole
     whenever recusive calls to  `facsum' occur.

     Inclusion   of   the  atom `nextlayerfactor' in  the argument
     list of `facsum'  has the  effect of `nextlayerfactor: true', but
     for the next level of the expression only.  Since
     `nextlayerfactor' is  always bound to  either `true' or  `false',
     it must be presented single-quoted whenever it appears in the
     argument list of `facsum'.


 -- Global variable: facsum_combine
     Default value: `true'

     `facsum_combine' controls the form  of the final result  returned
     by `facsum'  when  its  argument  is  a  quotient  of
     polynomials.   If `facsum_combine' is `false'  then the form will
     be returned as  a fully expanded  sum  as described  above,  but
     if  `true',  then  the expression returned is a ratio of
     polynomials, with each polynomial in the form described above.

     The `true' setting of this switch is useful when one wants to
     `facsum' both  the numerator and  denominator of  a rational
     expression,  but  does not  want  the denominator  to  be
     multiplied through the terms of the numerator.


 -- Function: factorfacsum (<expr>, <arg_1>, ... <arg_n>)
     Returns a  form of <expr>  which is obtained by calling  `facsum'
     on the factors  of <expr> with <arg_1>, ... <arg_n> as arguments.
     If any of the factors of <expr> is raised to a  power, both the
     factor and the exponent will be processed in this way.


 -- Function: collectterms (<expr>, <arg_1>, ..., <arg_n>)
     If several expressions have been simplified  with the following
     functions `facsum', `factorfacsum', `factenexpand', `facexpten' or
     `factorfacexpten', and they are to be added together, it may be
     desirable to combine them using the function  `collecterms'.
     `collecterms' can take as arguments all of the arguments that can
     be given to these other associated functions with the exception of
     `nextlayerfactor', which has no effect on `collectterms'.  The
     advantage of `collectterms' is that it returns a form  similar to
     `facsum', but since it is adding forms that have already been
     processed by `facsum', it does not need to repeat that effort.
     This capability is especially useful when the expressions to be
     summed are very large.

73.4 Package functs
===================

 -- Function: rempart (<expr>, <n>)

     To use this function write first `load(functs)'.


 -- Function: linear (<expr>, <x>)
     When <expr> is an expression of the form `<a>*<x> + <b>' where <a>
     is nonzero, and <a> and <b> are free of <x>, `linear' returns a
     list of three equations, one for each of the three formal
     variables <b>, <a>, and <x>. Otherwise, `linear' returns `false'.

     `load(antid)' loads this function.

     Example:

          (%i1) load (antid);
          (%o1)        /usr/share/maxima/5.29.1/share/integration/antid.mac
          (%i2) linear ((1 - w)*(1 - x)*z, z);
          (%o2)  [bargumentb = 0, aargumenta = (w - 1) x - w + 1, xargumentx = z]
          (%i3) linear (cos(u - v) + cos(u + v), u);
          (%o3)                                false


 -- Function: gcdivide (<p>, <q>)
     When the option variable `takegcd' is `true' which is the default,
     `gcdivide' divides the polynomials <p> and <q> by their greatest
     common divisor and returns the ratio of the results.  `gcdivde'
     calls the function `ezgcd'  to divide the polynomials by the
     greatest common divisor.

     When `takegcd' is `false', `gcdivide' returns the ratio `<p>/<q>'.

     To use this function write first `load(functs)'.

     See also `ezgcd',  `gcd',  `gcdex',  and `poly_gcd'.

   Be careful about using parentheses around the inequalities: when the
user types in `(A > B) + (C = 5)' the result is `A + C > B + 5', but `A
> B + C = 5' is a syntax error, and `(A > B + C) = 5' is something else
entirely.

   Do `disprule (all)' to see a complete listing of the rule
definitions.

   The user will be queried if Maxima is unable to decide the sign of a
quantity multiplying an inequality.

   The most common mis-feature is illustrated by:

     (%i1) eq: a > b;
     (%o1)                              a > b
     (%i2) 2*eq;
     (%o2)                            2 (a > b)
     (%i3) % - eq;
     (%o3)                              a > b

   Another problem is 0 times an inequality; the default to have this
turn into 0 has been left alone. However, if you type
`X*<some_inequality>' and Maxima asks about the sign of `X' and you
respond `zero' (or `z'), the program returns `X*<some_inequality>' and
not use the information that `X' is 0. You should do `ev (%, x: 0)' in
such a case, as the database will only be used for comparison purposes
in decisions, and not for the purpose of evaluating `X'.

   The user may note a slower response when this package is loaded, as
the simplifier is forced to examine more rules than without the
package, so you might wish to remove the rules after making use of
them. Do `kill (rules)' to eliminate all of the rules (including any
that you might have defined); or you may be more selective by killing
only some of them; or use `remrule' on a specific rule.

   Note that if you load this package after defining your own rules you
will clobber your rules that have the same name. The rules in this
package are: `*rule1', ..., `*rule8', `+rule1', ..., `+rule18', and you
must enclose the rulename in quotes to refer to it, as in `remrule
("+", "+rule1")' to specifically remove the first rule on `"+"' or
`disprule ("*rule2")' to display the definition of the second
multiplicative rule.

73.6 Package rducon
===================

 -- Function: reduce_consts (<expr>)
     Replaces constant subexpressions of <expr> with constructed
     constant atoms, saving the definition of all these constructed
     constants in the list of equations `const_eqns', and returning the
     modified <expr>.  Those parts of <expr> are constant which return
     `true' when operated on by the function `constantp'.  Hence,
     before invoking `reduce_consts', one should do

          declare ([<objects to be given the constant property>], constant)$

     to set up a database of the constant quantities occurring in your
     expressions.

     If you are planning to generate Fortran output after these symbolic
     calculations, one of the first code sections should be the
     calculation of all constants.  To generate this code segment, do

          map ('fortran, const_eqns)$

     Variables besides `const_eqns' which affect `reduce_consts' are:

     `const_prefix' (default value: `xx') is the string of characters
     used to prefix all symbols generated by `reduce_consts' to
     represent constant subexpressions.

     `const_counter' (default value: 1) is the integer index used to
     generate unique symbols to represent each constant subexpression
     found by `reduce_consts'.

     demonstration of this function.

73.7 Package scifac
===================

 -- Function: gcfac (<expr>)
     `gcfac' is a factoring function that attempts to apply the same
     heuristics which scientists apply in trying to make expressions
     simpler.  `gcfac' is limited to monomial-type factoring.  For a
     sum, `gcfac' does the following:

       1. Factors over the integers.

       2. Factors out the largest powers of terms occurring as
          coefficients, regardless of the complexity of the terms.

       3. Uses (1) and (2) in factoring adjacent pairs of terms.

       4. Repeatedly and recursively applies these techniques until the
          expression no longer changes.

     Item (3) does not necessarily do an optimal job of pairwise
     factoring because of the combinatorially-difficult nature of
     finding which of all possible rearrangements of the pairs yields
     the most compact pair-factored result.

73.8 Package sqdnst
===================

 -- Function: sqrtdenest (<expr>)
     Denests `sqrt' of simple, numerical, binomial surds, where
     possible.  E.g.

          (%i1) load (sqdnst)$
          (%i2) sqrt(sqrt(3)/2+1)/sqrt(11*sqrt(2)-12);
                                              sqrt(3)

                                                 2
          (%o2)                        ---------------------
                                       sqrt(11 sqrt(2) - 12)
          (%i3) sqrtdenest(%);
                                            sqrt(3)   1

                                           3 2    - 2

     Sometimes it helps to apply `sqrtdenest' more than once, on such as
     `(19601-13860 sqrt(2))^(7/4)'.

     To use this function first load the `simplify_sum' package with

 -- Function: solve_rec (<eqn>, <var>, [<init>])
     Solves for hypergeometrical solutions to linear recurrence <eqn>
     with polynomials coefficient in variable <var>. Optional arguments
     <init> are initial conditions.

     `solve_rec' can solve linear recurrences with constant
     coefficients, finds hypergeometrical solutions to homogeneous
     linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients, rational
     solutions to linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients and
     can solve Ricatti type recurrences.

     Note that the running time of the algorithm used to find
     hypergeometrical solutions is exponential in the degree of the
     leading and trailing coefficient.

     To use this function first load the `solve_rec' package with
     `load(solve_rec);'.

     Example of linear recurrence with constant coefficients:

          (%i2) solve_rec(a[n]=a[n-1]+a[n-2]+n/2^n, a[n]);

     Example of linear recurrence with polynomial coefficients:

          (%i7) 2*x*(x+1)*y[x] - (x^2+3*x-2)*y[x+1] + (x-1)*y[x+2];

 -- Option variable: product_use_gamma
     Default value: `true'

     When simplifying products, `solve_rec' introduces gamma function
     into the expression if `product_use_gamma' is `true'.

     See also: `simplify_products', `solve_rec'.


 -- Function: summand_to_rec (<summand>, <k>, <n>)
 -- Function: summand_to_rec (<summand>, [<k>, <lo>, <hi>], <n>)
     Returns the recurrence sattisfied by the sum

               hi
              ====
              \
               >     summand
              /
              ====
            k = lo

     where summand is hypergeometrical in <k> and <n>. If <lo> and <hi>
     are omited, they are assumed to be `lo = -inf' and `hi = inf'.

     To use this function first load the `simplify_sum' package with
     `load(simplify_sum)'.

75.1 Introduction to stats
==========================

Package `stats' contains a set of classical statistical inference and
hypothesis testing procedures.

   All these functions return an `inference_result' Maxima object which
contains the necessary results for population inferences and decision
making.

   Global variable `stats_numer' controls whether results are given in
floating point or symbolic and rational format; its default value is
`true' and results are returned in floating point format.

   Package `descriptive' contains some utilities to manipulate data
structures (lists and matrices); for example, to extract subsamples. It
also contains some examples on how to use package `numericalio' to read
data from plain text files. See `descriptive' and `numericalio' for
more details.

   Package `stats' loads packages `descriptive', `distrib' and
`inference_result'.

75.2 Functions and Variables for inference_result
=================================================

 -- Function: inference_result (<title>, <values>, <numbers>)
     Constructs an `inference_result' object of the type returned by the
     stats functions. Argument <title> is a string with the name of the
     procedure; <values> is a list with elements of the form `symbol =
     value' and <numbers> is a list with positive integer numbers
     ranging from one to `length(<values>)', indicating which values
     will be shown by default.

     Example:

     This is a simple example showing results concerning a rectangle.
     The title of this object is the string `"Rectangle"', it stores
     five results, named `'base', `'height', `'diagonal', `'area', and
     `'perimeter', but only the first, second, fifth, and fourth will
     be displayed. The `'diagonal' is stored in this object, but it is
     not displayed; to access its value, make use of function
     `take_inference'.

          (%i1) load(inference_result)$
          (%i2) b: 3$ h: 2$
          (%i3) inference_result("Rectangle",
                                  ['base=b,
                                   'height=h,
                                   'diagonal=sqrt(b^2+h^2),
                                   'area=b*h,
                                   'perimeter=2*(b+h)],
                                  [1,2,5,4] );
                                  |   Rectangle
                                  |
                                  |    base = 3
                                  |
          (%o3)                   |   height = 2
                                  |
                                  | perimeter = 10
                                  |
                                  |    area = 6
          (%i4) take_inference('diagonal,%);
          (%o4)                        sqrt(13)

     See also `take_inference'.


 -- Function: inferencep (<obj>)
     Returns `true' or `false', depending on whether <obj> is an
     `inference_result' object or not.


 -- Function: items_inference (<obj>)
     Returns a list with the names of the items stored in <obj>, which
     must be an `inference_result' object.

     Example:

     The `inference_result' object stores two values, named `'pi' and
     `'e', but only the second is displayed. The `items_inference'
     function returns the names of all items, no matter they are
     displayed or not.

          (%i1) load(inference_result)$
          (%i2) inference_result("Hi", ['pi=%pi,'e=%e],[2]);
                                      |   Hi
          (%o2)                       |
                                      | e = %e
          (%i3) items_inference(%);
          (%o3)                        [pi, e]


 -- Function: take_inference (<n>, <obj>)
 -- Function: take_inference (<name>, <obj>)
 -- Function: take_inference (<list>, <obj>)
     Returns the <n>-th value stored in <obj> if <n> is a positive
     integer, or the item named <name> if this is the name of an item.
     If the first argument is a list of numbers and/or symbols,
     function `take_inference' returns a list with the corresponding
     results.

     Example:

     Given an `inference_result' object, function `take_inference' is
     called in order to extract some information stored in it.

          (%i1) load(inference_result)$
          (%i2) b: 3$ h: 2$
          (%i3) sol: inference_result("Rectangle",
                                      ['base=b,
                                       'height=h,
                                       'diagonal=sqrt(b^2+h^2),
                                       'area=b*h,
                                       'perimeter=2*(b+h)],
                                      [1,2,5,4] );
                                  |   Rectangle
                                  |

75.3 Functions and Variables for stats
======================================

 -- Option variable: stats_numer
     Default value: `true'

     If `stats_numer' is `true', inference statistical functions return
     their results in floating point numbers. If it is `false', results
     are given in symbolic and rational format.


 -- Function: test_mean (<x>)
 -- Function: test_mean (<x>, <options> ...)
     This is the mean <t>-test. Argument <x> is a list or a column
     matrix containing a one dimensional sample. It also performs an
     asymptotic test based on the Central Limit Theorem if option
     `'asymptotic' is `true'.

     Options:

        * `'mean', default `0', is the mean value to be checked.

        * `'alternative', default `'twosided', is the alternative
          hypothesis; valid values are: `'twosided', `'greater' and
          `'less'.

        * `'dev', default `'unknown', this is the value of the standard
          deviation when it is known; valid values are: `'unknown' or a
          positive expression.

        * `'conflevel', default `95/100', confidence level for the
          confidence interval; it must be an expression which takes a
          value in (0,1).

        * `'asymptotic', default `false', indicates whether it performs
          an exact <t>-test or an asymptotic one based on the Central
          Limit Theorem; valid values are `true' and `false'.


     The output of function `test_mean' is an `inference_result' Maxima
     object showing the following results:

       1. `'mean_estimate': the sample mean.

       2. `'conf_level': confidence level selected by the user.

       3. `'conf_interval': confidence interval for the population mean.

       4. `'method': inference procedure.

       5. `'hypotheses': null and alternative hypotheses to be tested.

       6. `'statistic': value of the sample statistic used for testing
          the null hypothesis.

       7. `'distribution': distribution of the sample statistic,
          together with its parameter(s).

       8. `'p_value': p-value of the test.


     Examples:

     Performs an exact <t>-test with unknown variance. The null
     hypothesis is H_0: mean=50 against the one sided alternative H_1:
     mean<50; according to the results, the p-value is too great, there
     are no evidence for rejecting H_0.

          (%i1) load("stats")$
          (%i2) data: [78,64,35,45,45,75,43,74,42,42]$

                    |
                    |              conf_level = 0.9

                    |
          (%o3)     |  method = Exact t-test. Unknown variance.

                    |       distribution = [student_t, 9]
                    |
                    |        p_value = .7845100411786889

     This time Maxima performs an asymptotic test, based on the Central
     Limit Theorem.  The null hypothesis is H_0: equal(mean, 50)
     against the two sided alternative H_1: not equal(mean, 50);
     according to the results, the p-value is very small, H_0 should be
     rejected in favor of the alternative H_1. Note that, as indicated
     by the `Method' component, this procedure should be applied to
     large samples.

 -- Function: test_means_difference (<x1>, <x2>)
 -- Function: test_means_difference (<x1>, <x2>, <options> ...)
     This is the difference of means <t>-test for two samples.
     Arguments <x1> and <x2> are lists or column matrices containing
     two independent samples. In case of different unknown variances
     (see options `'dev1', `'dev2' and `'varequal' bellow), the degrees
     of freedom are computed by means of the Welch approximation.  It
     also performs an asymptotic test based on the Central Limit
     Theorem if option `'asymptotic' is set to `true'.

     Options:

        *        * `'alternative', default `'twosided', is the
          alternative hypothesis; valid values are: `'twosided',
          `'greater' and `'less'.

        * `'dev1', default `'unknown', this is the value of the
          standard deviation of the <x1> sample when it is known; valid
          values are: `'unknown' or a positive expression.

        * `'dev2', default `'unknown', this is the value of the
          standard deviation of the <x2> sample when it is known; valid
          values are: `'unknown' or a positive expression.

        * `'varequal', default `false', whether variances should be
          considered to be equal or not; this option takes effect only
          when `'dev1' and/or `'dev2' are  `'unknown'.

        * `'conflevel', default `95/100', confidence level for the
          confidence interval; it must be an expression which takes a
          value in (0,1).

        * `'asymptotic', default `false', indicates whether it performs
          an exact <t>-test or an asymptotic one based on the Central
          Limit Theorem; valid values are `true' and `false'.


     The output of function `test_means_difference' is an
     `inference_result' Maxima object showing the following results:

       1. `'diff_estimate': the difference of means estimate.

       2. `'conf_level': confidence level selected by the user.

       3. `'conf_interval': confidence interval for the difference of
          means.

       4. `'method': inference procedure.

       5. `'hypotheses': null and alternative hypotheses to be tested.

       6. `'statistic': value of the sample statistic used for testing
          the null hypothesis.

       7. `'distribution': distribution of the sample statistic,
          together with its parameter(s).

       8. `'p_value': p-value of the test.


     Examples:

     The equality of means is tested with two small samples <x> and <y>,
     against the alternative H_1: m_1>m_2, being m_1 and m_2 the
     populations means; variances are unknown and supposed to be
     different.

 -- Function: test_signed_rank (<x>)
 -- Function: test_signed_rank (<x>, <options> ...)
     This is the Wilcoxon signed rank test to make inferences about the
     median of a continuous population. Argument <x> is a list or a
     column matrix containing a one dimensional sample. Performs normal
     approximation if the sample size is greater than 20, or if there
     are zeroes or ties.

     See also `pdf_rank_test' and `cdf_rank_test'.

     Options:

        * `'median', default `0', is the median value to be checked.

        * `'alternative', default `'twosided', is the alternative
          hypothesis; valid values are: `'twosided', `'greater' and
          `'less'.

     The function `stirling' knows the difference between the variable
     'gamma' and the function gamma:

          (%i5) stirling(gamma + gamma(x),0);
                                              x - 1/2   - x
          (%o5)    gamma + sqrt(2) sqrt(%pi) x        %e
          (%i6) stirling(gamma(y) + gamma(x),0);
                                   y - 1/2   - y
          (%o6) sqrt(2) sqrt(%pi) y        %e
                                                        x - 1/2   - x
                                   + sqrt(2) sqrt(%pi) x        %e

     To apply the Stirling formula only to terms that involve the
     variable `k', use an optional third argument; for example
          (%i7) makegamma(pochhammer(a,k)/pochhammer(b,k));
          (%o7) (gamma(b)*gamma(k+a))/(gamma(a)*gamma(k+b))
          (%i8) stirling(%,1, lambda([s], not(freeof(k,s))));
          (%o8) (%e^(b-a)*gamma(b)*(k+a)^(k+a-1/2)*(k+b)^(-k-b+1/2))/gamma(a)
     The terms `gamma(a)' and `gamma(b)' are free of `k', so the
     Stirling formula was not applied to these two terms.

     To use this function write first `load("stirling")'.

77.1 Introduction to string processing
======================================

`stringproc.lisp' enlarges Maximas capabilities of working with strings
and adds some useful functions for file in/output.

   For questions and bugs please mail to van.nek at arcor.de .

   In Maxima a string is easily constructed by typing "text".
`stringp' tests for strings.

     (%i1) m: "text";
     (%o1)                         text
     (%i2) stringp(m);
     (%o2)                         true

   Characters are represented as strings of length 1.  These are not
Lisp characters.  Tests can be done with `charp' (respectively `lcharp'
and conversion from Lisp to Maxima characters with `cunlisp').

     (%i1) c: "e";
     (%o1)                           e
     (%i2) [charp(c),lcharp(c)];
     (%o2)                     [true, false]
     (%i3) supcase(c);
     (%o3)                           E
     (%i4) charp(%);
     (%o4)                         true

   All functions in `stringproc.lisp' that return characters, return
Maxima-characters.  Due to the fact, that the introduced characters are
strings of length 1, you can use a lot of string functions also for
characters.  As seen, `supcase' is one example.

   It is important to know, that the first character in a Maxima-string
is at position 1.  This is designed due to the fact that the first
element in a Maxima-list is at position 1 too.  See definitions of
`charat' and `charlist' for examples.

   In applications string-functions are often used when working with
files.  You will find some useful stream- and print-functions in
`stringproc.lisp'.  The following example shows some of the here
introduced functions at work.

   Example:

   `openw' returns an output stream to a file, `printf' then allows
formatted writing to this file. See `printf' for details.

     (%i1) s: openw("E:/file.txt");
     (%o1)                    #<output stream E:/file.txt>
     (%i2) for n:0 thru 10 do printf( s, "~d ", fib(n) );
     (%o2)                                done
     (%i3) printf( s, "~%~d ~f ~a ~a ~f ~e ~a~%",
                   42,1.234,sqrt(2),%pi,1.0e-2,1.0e-2,1.0b-2 );
     (%o3)                                false
     (%i4) close(s);
     (%o4)                                true

   After closing the stream you can open it again, this time with input
direction.  `readline' returns the entire line as one string. The
`stringproc' package now offers a lot of functions for manipulating
strings. Tokenizing can be done by `split' or `tokens'.

     (%i5) s: openr("E:/file.txt");
     (%o5)                     #<input stream E:/file.txt>
     (%i6) readline(s);
     (%o6)                     0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
     (%i7) line: readline(s);
     (%o7)               42 1.234 sqrt(2) %pi 0.01 1.0E-2 1.0b-2
     (%i8) list: tokens(line);
     (%o8)           [42, 1.234, sqrt(2), %pi, 0.01, 1.0E-2, 1.0b-2]
     (%i9) map( parse_string, list );
     (%o9)            [42, 1.234, sqrt(2), %pi, 0.01, 0.01, 1.0b-2]
     (%i10) float(%);
     (%o10) [42.0, 1.234, 1.414213562373095, 3.141592653589793, 0.01,
                                                          0.01, 0.01]
     (%i11) readline(s);
     (%o11)                               false
     (%i12) close(s)$

   `readline' returns `false' when the end of file occurs.

77.2 Functions and Variables for input and output
=================================================

Example:

     (%i1) s: openw("E:/file.txt");
     (%o1)                     #<output stream E:/file.txt>
     (%i2) control:
     "~2tAn atom: ~20t~a~%~2tand a list: ~20t~{~r ~}~%~2t\
     and an integer: ~20t~d~%"$
     (%i3) printf( s,control, 'true,[1,2,3],42 )$
     (%o3)                                false
     (%i4) close(s);
     (%o4)                                true
     (%i5) s: openr("E:/file.txt");
     (%o5)                     #<input stream E:/file.txt>
     (%i6) while stringp( tmp:readline(s) ) do print(tmp)$
       An atom:          true
       and a list:       one two three
       and an integer:   42
     (%i7) close(s)$

 -- Function: close (<stream>)
     Closes <stream> and returns `true' if <stream> had been open.


 -- Function: flength (<stream>)
     Returns the number of elements in <stream>.


 -- Function: fposition (<stream>)
 -- Function: fposition (<stream>, <pos>)
     Returns the current position in <stream>, if <pos> is not used.
     If <pos> is used, `fposition' sets the position in <stream>.
     <pos> has to be a positive number, the first element in <stream>
     is in position 1.


 -- Function: freshline ()
 -- Function: freshline (<stream>)
     Writes a new line (to <stream>), if the position is not at the
     beginning of a line.  See also `newline'.


 -- Function: newline ()
 -- Function: newline (<stream>)
     Writes a new line (to <stream>).  See `sprint' for an example of
     using `newline()'.  Note that there are some cases, where
     `newline()' does not work as expected.


 -- Function: opena (<file>)
     Returns an output stream to <file>.  If an existing file is
     opened, `opena' appends elements at the end of file.


 -- Function: openr (<file>)
     Returns an input stream to <file>.  If <file> does not exist, it
     will be created.


 -- Function: openw (<file>)
     Returns an output stream to <file>.  If <file> does not exist, it
     will be created.  If an existing file is opened, `openw'
     destructively modifies <file>.


 -- Function: printf (<dest>, <string>)
 -- Function: printf (<dest>, <string>, <expr_1>, ..., <expr_n>)
     Makes the Common Lisp function FORMAT available in Maxima.  (From
     gcl.info: "format produces formatted output by outputting the
     characters of control-string string and observing that a tilde
     introduces a directive.  The character after the tilde, possibly
     preceded by prefix parameters and modifiers, specifies what kind
     of formatting is desired.  Most directives use one or more
     elements of args to create their output.")

     The following description and the examples may give an idea of
     using `printf'.  See a Lisp reference for more information.

             ~%       new line
             ~&       fresh line
             ~t       tab
             ~$       monetary
             ~d       decimal integer
             ~b       binary integer
             ~o       octal integer
             ~x       hexadecimal integer
             ~br      base-b integer
             ~r       spell an integer
             ~p       plural
             ~f       floating point
             ~e       scientific notation
             ~g       ~f or ~e, depending upon magnitude
             ~h       bigfloat
             ~a       uses Maxima function string
             ~s       like ~a, but output enclosed in "double quotes"
             ~~       ~
             ~<       justification, ~> terminates
             ~(       case conversion, ~) terminates
             ~[       selection, ~] terminates
             ~{       iteration, ~} terminates

     Note that the selection directive `~[' is zero-indexed.  Also note
     that the directive ~* is not supported.

          (%i1) printf( false, "~a ~a ~4f ~a ~@r",
                        "String",sym,bound,sqrt(12),144), bound = 1.234;
          (%o1)                 String sym 1.23 2*sqrt(3) CXLIV
          (%i2) printf( false,"~{~a ~}",["one",2,"THREE"] );
          (%o2)                          one 2 THREE
          (%i3) printf(true,"~{~{~9,1f ~}~%~}",mat ),
                    mat = args(matrix([1.1,2,3.33],[4,5,6],[7,8.88,9]))$
                1.1       2.0       3.3
                4.0       5.0       6.0
                7.0       8.9       9.0
          (%i4) control: "~:(~r~) bird~p ~[is~;are~] singing."$
          (%i5) printf( false,control, n,n,if n=1 then 0 else 1 ), n=2;
          (%o5)                    Two birds are singing.

     If <dest> is a stream or `true', then `printf' returns `false'.
     Otherwise, `printf' returns a string containing the output.


 -- Function: readline (<stream>)
     Returns a string containing the characters from the current
     position in <stream> up to the end of the line or <false> if the
     end of the file is encountered.


 -- Function: sprint (<expr_1>, ..., <expr_n>)
     Evaluates and displays its arguments one after the other `on a
     line' starting at the leftmost position.  The numbers are printed
     with the '-' right next to the number, and it disregards line
     length.  `newline()', which will be autoloaded from
     `stringproc.lisp' might be useful, if you whish to place
     intermediate line breaking.

     Example:

          (%i1) for n:0 thru 19 do sprint( fib(n) )$
          0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181
          (%i2) for n:0 thru 22 do (
                   sprint(fib(n)), if mod(n,10)=9 then newline() )$
          0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
          55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181

          (%o3)                  A hollow submarine.


 -- Function: sinvertcase (<string>)
 -- Function: sinvertcase (<string>, <start>)
 -- Function: sinvertcase (<string>, <start>, <end>)
     Returns <string> except that each character from position <start>
     to <end> is inverted.  If <end> is not given, all characters from
     <start> to the end of <string> are replaced.

          (%i1) sinvertcase("sInvertCase");

 -- Function: smismatch (<string_1>, <string_2>, <test>)
     Returns the position of the first character of <string_1> at which
     <string_1> and <string_2> differ or `false'.  Default test
     function for matching is `sequal'.  If `smismatch' should ignore
     case, use `sequalignore' as test.

 -- Function: split (<string>)
 -- Function: split (<string>, <delim>)
 -- Function: split (<string>, <delim>, <multiple>)
     Returns the list of all tokens in <string>.  Each token is an
     unparsed string.  `split' uses <delim> as delimiter.  If <delim>
     is not given, the space character is the default delimiter.
     <multiple> is a boolean variable with `true' by default.  Multiple
     delimiters are read as one.  This is useful if tabs are saved as
     multiple space characters.  If <multiple> is set to `false', each
     delimiter is noted.

          (%i1) split("1.2   2.3   3.4   4.5");
          (%o1)                 [1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 4.5]

     Returns a string like <string> but without all substrings matching
     <seq>.  Default test function for matching is `sequal'.  If
     `sremove' should ignore case while searching for <seq>, use
     `sequalignore' as test.  Use <start> and <end> to limit searching.
     Note that the first character in <string> is in position 1.

          (%i1) sremove("n't","I don't like coffee.");
          (%o1)                   I do like coffee.
          (%i2) sremove ("DO ",%,'sequalignore);

     matches the string <seq>.  Default test function for matching is
     `sequal'.  If `ssearch' should ignore case, use `sequalignore' as
     test.  Use <start> and <end> to limit searching.  Note that the
     first character in <string> is in position 1.

          (%i1) ssearch("~s","~{~S ~}~%",'sequalignore);
          (%o1)                                  4

     order such there are no two successive characters <c> and <d> such
     that `test (<c>, <d>)' is `false' and `test (<d>, <c>)' is `true'.
     Default test function for sorting is <clessp>.  The set of test
     functions is `{clessp, clesspignore, cgreaterp, cgreaterpignore,

          (%i1) ssort("I don't like Mondays.");

 -- Function: ssubst (<new>, <old>, <string>, <test>, <start>)
 -- Function: ssubst (<new>, <old>, <string>, <test>, <start>, <end>)
     Returns a string like <string> except that all substrings matching
     <old> are replaced by <new>.  <old> and <new> need not to be of
     the same length.  Default test function for matching is `sequal'.
     If `ssubst' should ignore case while searching for old, use
     `sequalignore' as test.  Use <start> and <end> to limit searching.
     Note that the first character in <string> is in position 1.

          (%i1) ssubst("like","hate","I hate Thai food. I hate green tea.");
          (%o1)          I like Thai food. I like green tea.

 -- Function: substring (<string>, <start>)
 -- Function: substring (<string>, <start>, <end>)
     Returns the substring of <string> beginning at position <start>
     and ending at position <end>.  The character at position <end> is
     not included.  If <end> is not given, the substring contains the

     in position 1.

          (%i1) substring("substring",4);
          (%o1)                        string

     Returns <string> except that lowercase characters from position
     <start> to <end> are replaced by the corresponding uppercase ones.
     If <end> is not given, all lowercase characters from <start> to
     the end of <string> are replaced.

          (%i1) supcase("english",1,2);
          (%o1)                        English


 -- Function: tokens (<string>)
 -- Function: tokens (<string>, <test>)
     Returns a list of tokens, which have been extracted from <string>.
     The tokens are substrings whose characters satisfy a certain test
     function.  If test is not given, <constituent> is used as the
     default test.  `{constituent, alphacharp, digitcharp, lowercasep,
     uppercasep, charp, characterp, alphanumericp}' is the set of test
     functions.  (The Lisp-version of `tokens' is written by Paul
     Graham. ANSI Common Lisp, 1996, page 67.)

          (%i1) tokens("24 October 2005");

78.1 Functions and Variables for to_poly_solve
==============================================

The packages `to_poly' and `to_poly_solve' are experimental; the
specifications of the functions in these packages might change or the
some of the functions in these packages might be merged into other
Maxima functions.

   Barton Willis (Professor of Mathematics, University of Nebraska at
Kearney) wrote the `to_poly' and `to_poly_solve' packages and the
English language user documentation for these packages.

 -- Operator: %and
     The operator `%and' is a simplifying nonshort-circuited logical
     conjunction.  Maxima simplifies an `%and' expression to either
     true, false, or a logically equivalent, but simplified,
     expression.  The operator `%and' is associative, commutative, and
     idempotent.  Thus when `%and' returns a noun form, the arguments
     of `%and' form a non-redundant sorted list; for example

          (%i1) a %and (a %and b);
          (%o1)                       a %and b

     If one argument to a conjunction is the explicit the negation of
     another argument, `%and' returns false:

          (%i2) a %and (not a);
          (%o2)                         false

     If any member of the conjunction is false, the conjunction
     simplifies to false even if other members are manifestly
     non-boolean; for example

          (%i3) 42 %and false;
          (%o3)                         false

     Any argument of an `%and' expression that is an inequation (that
     is, an inequality or equation), is simplified using the Fourier
     elimination package.  The Fourier elimination simplifier has a
     pre-processor that converts some, but not all, nonlinear
     inequations into linear inequations; for example the Fourier
     elimination code simplifies `abs(x) + 1 > 0' to true, so

          (%i4) (x < 1) %and (abs(x) + 1 > 0);
          (%o4)                         x < 1

     Notes
        * The option variable `prederror' does not alter the
          simplification `%and' expressions.

        * To avoid operator precedence errors, compound expressions
          involving the operators `%and, %or', and `not' should be
          fully parenthesized.

        * The Maxima operators `and' and `or' are both short-circuited.
          Thus `and' isn't associative or commutative.


     Limitations The conjunction `%and' simplifies inequations locally,
     not globally.  This means that conjunctions such as

          (%i5) (x < 1) %and (x > 1);
          (%o5)                 (x > 1) %and (x < 1)

     do not simplify to false.  Also, the Fourier elimination code
     ignores the fact database;

          (%i6) assume(x > 5);
          (%o6)                        [x > 5]
          (%i7) (x > 1) %and (x > 2);
          (%o7)                 (x > 1) %and (x > 2)

     Finally, nonlinear inequations that aren't easily converted into an
     equivalent linear inequation aren't simplified.

     There is no support for distributing `%and' over `%or'; neither is
     there support for distributing a logical negation over `%and'.

     Related functions `%or, %if, and, or, not'

     Status The operator `%and' is experimental; the specifications of
     this function might change and its functionality might be merged
     into other Maxima functions.


 -- Operator: %if (<bool>, <a>, <b>)
     The operator `%if' is a simplifying conditional.  The conditional
     <bool> should be boolean-valued.  When the conditional is true,
     return the second argument; when the conditional is false, return
     the third; in all other cases, return a noun form.

     Maxima inequations (either an inequality or an equality) are not
     boolean-valued; for example, Maxima does not simplify 5 < 6 to
     true, and it does not simplify 5 = 6 to false; however, in the
     context of a conditional to an `%if' statement, Maxima
     automatically attempts to determine the truth value of an
     inequation.  Examples:

          (%i1) f : %if(x # 1, 2, 8);
          (%o1)                 %if(x - 1 # 0, 2, 8)
          (%i2) [subst(x = -1,f), subst(x=1,f)];
          (%o2)                        [2, 8]

     If the conditional involves an inequation, Maxima simplifies it
     using the Fourier elimination package.

     Notes

        * If the conditional is manifestly non-boolean, Maxima returns
          a noun form:

          (%i3) %if(42,1,2);
          (%o3)                     %if(42, 1, 2)

        * The Maxima operator `if' is nary, the operator `%if' isn't
          nary.

     Limitations The Fourier elimination code only simplifies nonlinear
     inequations that are readily convertible to an equivalent linear
     inequation.

     To use: `load(to_poly_solve)'

     Status: The operator `%if' is experimental; its specifications
     might change and its functionality might be merged into other
     Maxima functions.


 -- Operator: %or
     The operator `%or' is a simplifying nonshort-circuited logical
     disjunction.  Maxima simplifies an `%or' expression to either
     true, false, or a logically equivalent, but simplified,
     expression.  The operator `%or' is associative, commutative, and
     idempotent.  Thus when `%or' returns a noun form, the arguments of
     `%or' form a non-redundant sorted list; for example

          (%i1) a %or (a %or b);
          (%o1)                        a %or b

     If one member of the disjunction is the explicit the negation of
     another member, `%or' returns true:

          (%i2) a %or (not a);
          (%o2)                         true

     If any member of the disjunction is true, the disjunction
     simplifies to true even if other members of the disjunction are
     manifestly non-boolean; for example

          (%i3) 42 %or true;
          (%o3)                         true

     Any argument of an `%or' expression that is an inequation (that
     is, an inequality or equation), is simplified using the Fourier
     elimination package.  The Fourier elimination code simplifies
     `abs(x) + 1 > 0' to true, so we have

          (%i4) (x < 1) %or (abs(x) + 1 > 0);
          (%o4)                         true

     Notes
        * The option variable `prederror' does not alter the
          simplification of `%or' expressions.

        * You should parenthesize compound expressions involving the
          operators `%and, %or', and `not'; the binding powers of these
          operators might not match your expectations.

        * The Maxima operators `and' and `or' are both short-circuited.
          Thus `or' isn't associative or commutative.


     Limitations The conjunction `%or' simplifies inequations locally,
     not globally.  This means that conjunctions such as

          (%i1) (x < 1) %or (x >= 1);
          (%o1) (x > 1) %or (x >= 1)

     do not simplify to true.  Further, the Fourier elimination code
     ignores the fact database;

          (%i2) assume(x > 5);
          (%o2)                        [x > 5]
          (%i3) (x > 1) %and (x > 2);
          (%o3)                 (x > 1) %and (x > 2)

     Finally, nonlinear inequations that aren't easily converted into an
     equivalent linear inequation aren't simplified.

     The algorithm that looks for terms that cannot both be false is
     weak; also there is no support for distributing `%or' over `%and';
     neither is there support for distributing a logical negation over
     `%or'.

     Related functions `%or, %if, and, or, not'

     Status The operator `%or' is experimental; the specifications of
     this function might change and its functionality might be merged
     into other Maxima functions.


 -- Function: complex_number_p (<x>)
     The predicate `complex_number_p' returns true if its argument is
     either `a + %i * b', `a', `%i b', or `%i', where `a' and `b' are
     either rational or floating point numbers (including big floating
     point); for all other inputs, `complex_number_p' returns false;
     for example

          (%i1) map('complex_number_p,[2/3, 2 + 1.5 * %i, %i]);
          (%o1)                  [true, true, true]
          (%i2) complex_number_p((2+%i)/(5-%i));
          (%o2)                         false
          (%i3) complex_number_p(cos(5 - 2 * %i));

     Status The operator `complex_number_p' is experimental; its
     specifications might change and its functionality might be merged
     into other Maxima functions.


 -- Function: compose_functions (<l>)
     The function call `compose_functions(l)' returns a lambda form
     that is the composition of the functions in the list <l>.  The
     functions are applied from right to left; for example

          (%i1) compose_functions([cos, exp]);
                                                  %g151
          (%o1)             lambda([%g151], cos(%e     ))
          (%i2) %(x);
                                            x
          (%o2)                       cos(%e )

     When the function list is empty, return the identity function:

          (%i3) compose_functions([]);
          (%o3)                lambda([%g152], %g152)
          (%i4)  %(x);
          (%o4)                           x

     Notes
        * When Maxima determines that a list member isn't a symbol or a
          lambda form, `funmake' (not `compose_functions') signals an
          error:

          (%i5) compose_functions([a < b]);

          funmake: first argument must be a symbol, subscripted symbol,
          string, or lambda expression; found: a < b
          #0: compose_functions(l=[a < b])(to_poly_solve.mac line 40)
           -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);

        * To avoid name conflicts, the independent variable is
          determined by the function `new_variable'.

          (%i6) compose_functions([%g0]);
          (%o6)              lambda([%g154], %g0(%g154))
          (%i7) compose_functions([%g0]);
          (%o7)              lambda([%g155], %g0(%g155))

          Although the independent variables are different, Maxima is
          able to to deduce that these lambda forms are semantically
          equal:

          (%i8) is(equal(%o6,%o7));
          (%o8)                         true

 -- Function: dfloat (<x>)
     The function `dfloat' is a similar to `float', but the function
     `dfloat' applies `rectform' when `float' fails to evaluate to an
     IEEE double floating point number; thus

          (%i1) float(4.5^(1 + %i));

     Notes

        * The rectangular form of an expression might be poorly suited
          for numerical evaluation-for example, the rectangular form
          might needlessly involve the difference of floating point
          numbers (subtractive cancellation).

        * The identifier `float' is both an option variable (default
          value false) and a function name.

 -- Function: elim (<l>, <x>)
     The function `elim' eliminates the variables in the set or list
     `x' from the equations in the set or list `l'.  Each member of `x'
     must be a symbol; the members of `l' can either be equations, or
     expressions that are assumed to equal zero.

     The function `elim' returns a list of two lists; the first is the
     list of expressions with the variables eliminated; the second is
     the list of pivots; thus, the second list is a list of expressions
     that `elim' used to eliminate the variables.

     Here is a example of eliminating between linear equations:

          (%i1) elim(set(x + y + z = 1, x - y  - z = 8, x - z = 1),
                     set(x,y));
          (%o1)            [[2 z - 7], [y + 7, z - x + 1]]

     Eliminating `x' and `y' yields the single equation `2 z - 7 = 0';
     the equations `y + 7 = 0' and `z - z + 1 = 1' were used as pivots.
     Eliminating all three variables from these equations,
     triangularizes the linear system:

          (%i2) elim(set(x + y + z = 1, x - y  - z = 8, x - z = 1),
                     set(x,y,z));
          (%o2)           [[], [2 z - 7, y + 7, z - x + 1]]

     Of course, the equations needn't be linear:

          (%i3) elim(set(x^2 - 2 * y^3 = 1,  x - y = 5), [x,y]);
                               3    2
          (%o3)       [[], [2 y  - y  - 10 y - 24, y - x + 5]]

     The user doesn't control the order the variables are eliminated.
     Instead, the algorithm uses a heuristic to attempt to choose the
     best pivot and the best elimination order.

     Notes

        * Unlike the related function `eliminate', the function `elim'
          does not invoke `solve' when the number of equations equals
          the number of variables.

        * The function `elim' works by applying resultants; the option
          variable `resultant' determines which algorithm Maxima uses.
          Using `sqfr', Maxima factors each resultant and suppresses
          multiple zeros.

        * The `elim' will triangularize a nonlinear set of polynomial
          equations; the solution set of the triangularized set can be
          larger than that solution set of the untriangularized set.
          Thus, the triangularized equations can have spurious
          solutions.

 -- Function: fourier_elim ([<eq1>, <eq2>, ...], [<var1>, <var>, ...])
     Fourier elimination is the analog of Gauss elimination for linear
     inequations (equations or inequalities).  The function call
     `fourier_elim([eq1, eq2, ...], [var1, var2, ...]' does Fourier
     elimination on a list of linear inequations `[eq1, eq2, ...]' with
     respect to the variables `[var1, var2, ...]'; for example

          (%i1) fourier_elim([y-x < 5, x - y < 7, 10 < y],[x,y]);
          (%o1)            [y - 5 < x, x < y + 7, 10 < y]
          (%i2) fourier_elim([y-x < 5, x - y < 7, 10 < y],[y,x]);
          (%o2)        [max(10, x - 7) < y, y < x + 5, 5 < x]

     Eliminating first with respect to x and second with respect to y
     yields lower and upper bounds for x that depend on y, and lower
     and upper bounds for y that are numbers.  Eliminating in the other
     order gives x dependent lower and upper bounds for y, and
     numerical lower and upper bounds for x.

     When necessary, `fourier_elim' returns a _disjunction_ of lists of
     inequations:

          (%i3) fourier_elim([x # 6],[x]);
          (%o3)                  [x < 6] or [6 < x]

     When the solution set is empty,  `fourier_elim' returns `emptyset',
     and when the solution set is all reals, `fourier_elim' returns
     `universalset'; for example

          (%i4) fourier_elim([x < 1, x > 1],[x]);
          (%o4)                       emptyset
          (%i5) fourier_elim([minf < x, x < inf],[x]);
          (%o5)                     universalset

     For nonlinear inequations, `fourier_elim' returns a (somewhat)
     simplified list of inequations:

          (%i6) fourier_elim([x^3 - 1 > 0],[x]);
                         2                             2
          (%o6) [1 < x, x  + x + 1 > 0] or [x < 1, - (x  + x + 1) > 0]
          (%i7) fourier_elim([cos(x) < 1/2],[x]);
          (%o7)                  [1 - 2 cos(x) > 0]

     Instead of a list of inequations, the first argument to
     `fourier_elim' may be a logical disjunction or conjunction:

          (%i8) fourier_elim((x + y < 5) and (x - y >8),[x,y]);
                                                        3
          (%o8)            [y + 8 < x, x < 5 - y, y < - -]
                                                        2
          (%i9) fourier_elim(((x + y < 5) and x < 1) or  (x - y >8),[x,y]);
          (%o9)          [y + 8 < x] or [x < min(1, 5 - y)]

     The function `fourier_elim' supports the inequation operators `<,
     <=, >, >=, #', and `='.

     The Fourier elimination code has a preprocessor that converts some
     nonlinear inequations that involve the absolute value, minimum, and
     maximum functions into linear in equations.  Additionally, the
     preprocessor handles some expressions that are the product or
     quotient of linear terms:

          (%i10) fourier_elim([max(x,y) > 6, x # 8, abs(y-1) > 12],[x,y]);
          (%o10) [6 < x, x < 8, y < - 11] or [8 < x, y < - 11]
           or [x < 8, 13 < y] or [x = y, 13 < y] or [8 < x, x < y, 13 < y]
           or [y < x, 13 < y]
          (%i11) fourier_elim([(x+6)/(x-9) <= 6],[x]);
          (%o11)           [x = 12] or [12 < x] or [x < 9]
          (%i12) fourier_elim([x^2 - 1 # 0],[x]);

 -- Function: isreal_p (<e>)
     The predicate `isreal_p' returns true when Maxima is able to

     real-valued on some nonempty subset of the real line; and it

     should be able to return false; a simple example: the logarithm
     function isn't real-valued on the entire real line, so
     `isreal_p(log(x))' should return false; however

          (%i5) isreal_p(log(x));

 -- Function: new_variable (type)
     Return a unique symbol of the form `%[z,n,r,c,g]k', where `k' is
     an integer.  The allowed values for type are integer,
     natural_number, real, natural_number, and general.  (By natural
     number, we mean the nonnegative integers; thus zero is a natural
     number.  Some, but not all,definitions of natural number exclude
     zero.)

     When type isn't one of the allowed values, type defaults to
     general.  For integers, natural numbers, and complex numbers,
     Maxima automatically appends this information to the fact database.

          (%o2)                 parg(x + %i sqrt(x))

     When `sign' can determine that the input is a positive or negative
     real number, `parg' will return a non-noun form for a non-constant
     input.  Here are two examples:

          (%i3) simp_inequality(x > 0);

     This function applies the identities `cot(x) = atan(1/x), acsc(x)
     = asin(1/x),' and similarly for `asec, acoth, acsch' and `asech'
     to an expression.  See Abramowitz and Stegun, Eqs. 4.4.6 through

 -- Function: subst_parallel (<l>, <e>)
     When `l' is a single equation or a list of equations, substitute
     the right hand side of each equation for the left hand side.  The
     substitutions are made in parallel; for example

          (%i1) load(to_poly_solve)$

          (%i2) subst_parallel([x=y,y=x], [x,y]);
          (%o2)                        [y, x]

     Compare this to substitutions made serially:

          (%i3) subst([x=y,y=x],[x,y]);
          (%o3)                        [x, x]

     The function `subst_parallel' is similar to `sublis' except that
     `subst_parallel' allows for substitution of nonatoms; for example

          (%i4) subst_parallel([x^2 = a, y = b], x^2 * y);
          (%o4)                          a b
          (%i5) sublis([x^2 = a, y = b], x^2 * y);

                                                                       2
          sublis: left-hand side of equation must be a symbol; found: x
           -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);

     The substitutions made by `subst_parallel' are literal, not
     semantic; thus `subst_parallel' does not recognize that x * y is a
     subexpression of x^2 * y

          (%i6) subst_parallel([x * y = a], x^2 * y);
                                         2
          (%o6)                         x  y

     The function `subst_parallel' completes all substitutions before
     simplifications.  This allows for substitutions into conditional
     expressions where errors might occur if the simplifications were
     made earlier:

          (%i7) subst_parallel([x = 0], %if(x < 1, 5, log(x)));
          (%o7)                           5
          (%i8) subst([x = 0], %if(x < 1, 5, log(x)));

          log: encountered log(0).
           -- an error. To debug this try: debugmode(true);

 -- Function: to_poly (<e>, <l>)
     The function `to_poly' attempts to convert the equation `e' into a
     polynomial system along with inequality constraints; the solutions
     to the polynomial system that satisfy the constraints are
     solutions to the equation `e'.  Informally, `to_poly' attempts to
     polynomialize the equation <e>; an example might clarify:

          (%i1) load(to_poly_solve)$

          (%i2) to_poly(sqrt(x) = 3, [x]);
                                      2
          (%o2) [[%g130 - 3, x = %g130 ],
                                %pi                               %pi
                             [- --- < parg(%g130), parg(%g130) <= ---], []]
                                 2                                 2

     The conditions `-%pi/2<parg(%g130),parg(%g130)<=%pi/2' tell us that
     `%g130' is in the range of the square root function.  When this is
     true, the solution set to `sqrt(x) = 3' is the same as the
     solution set to `%g130-3,x=%g130^2'.

     To polynomialize trigonometric expressions, it is necessary to
     introduce a non algebraic substitution; these non algebraic
     substitutions are returned in the third list returned by
     `to_poly'; for example

          (%i3) to_poly(cos(x),[x]);
                          2                                 %i x
          (%o3)    [[%g131  + 1], [2 %g131 # 0], [%g131 = %e    ]]

     Constant terms aren't polynomializied unless the number one is a
     member of the variable list; for example

          (%i4) to_poly(x = sqrt(5),[x]);
          (%o4)                [[x - sqrt(5)], [], []]
          (%i5) to_poly(x = sqrt(5),[1,x]);
                                      2
          (%o5) [[x - %g132, 5 = %g132 ],
                                %pi                               %pi
                             [- --- < parg(%g132), parg(%g132) <= ---], []]
                                 2                                 2

     To generate a polynomial with sqrt(5) + sqrt(7) as one of its
     roots, use the commands

          (%i6) first(elim_allbut(first(to_poly(x = sqrt(5) + sqrt(7),
                                                [1,x])), [x]));
                                    4       2
          (%o6)                   [x  - 24 x  + 4]

 -- Function: to_poly_solve (<e>, <l>, [options])
     The function `to_poly_solve' tries to solve the equations e for
     the variables l.  The equation(s) e can either be a single
     expression or a set or list of expressions; similarly, l can
     either be a single symbol or a list of set of symbols.  When a
     member of e isn't explicitly an equation, for example x^2 -1, the
     solver asummes that the expression vanishes.

     The basic strategy of `to_poly_solve' is use `to_poly' to convert
     the input into a polynomial form and call `algsys' on the
     polynomial system.  Thus user options that affect `algsys',
     especially `algexact', also affect `to_poly_solve'.  The default
     for `algexact' is false, but for `to_poly_solve', generally
     `algexact' should be true.  The function `to_poly_solve' does not
     locally set `algexact' to true because this would make it
     impossible to find approximate solutions when the `algsys' is
     unable to determine an exact solution.

     When `to_poly_solve' is able to determine the solution set, each
     member of the solution set is a list in a `%union' object:

          (%i1) load(to_poly_solve)$

          (%i2) to_poly_solve(x*(x-1) = 0, x);
          (%o2)               %union([x = 0], [x = 1])

     When  `to_poly_solve' is unable to determine the solution set, a
     `%solve' nounform is returned (in this case, a warning is printed)

          (%i3) to_poly_solve(x^k + 2* x + 1 = 0, x);

          Nonalgebraic argument given to 'to_poly'
          unable to solve
                                    k
          (%o3)            %solve([x  + 2 x + 1 = 0], [x])

     Subsitution into a `%solve' nounform can sometimes result in the
     solution

          (%i4) subst(k = 2, %);
          (%o4)                   %union([x = - 1])

     Especially for trigonometric equations, the solver sometimes needs
     to introduce an arbitary integer.  These arbitary integers have the
     form `%zXXX', where `XXX' is an integer; for example

          (%i5) to_poly_solve(sin(x) = 0, x);
          (%o5)   %union([x = 2 %pi %z33 + %pi], [x = 2 %pi %z35])

     To re-index these variables to zero, use `nicedummies':

          (%i6) nicedummies(%);
          (%o6)    %union([x = 2 %pi %z0 + %pi], [x = 2 %pi %z1])

     Occasionally, the solver introduces an arbitary complex number of
     the form `%cXXX' or an  arbitary real number of the form `%rXXX'.
     The function `nicedummies' will re-index these identifiers to zero.

     The solution set sometimes involves simplifing versions of various
     of logical operators including `%and', `%or', or `%if' for
     conjunction, disjuntion, and implication, respectively; for example

          (%i7) sol : to_poly_solve(abs(x) = a, x);
          (%o7) %union(%if(isnonnegative_p(a), [x = - a], %union()),
                                %if(isnonnegative_p(a), [x = a], %union()))
          (%i8) subst(a = 42, sol);
          (%o8)             %union([x = - 42], [x = 42])
          (%i9) subst(a = -42, sol);
          (%o9)                       %union()

     The empty set is represented by `%union'.

     The function `to_poly_solve' is able to solve some, but not all,
     equations involving rational powers, some nonrational powers,
     absolute values, trigonometric functions, and minimum and maximum.
     Also, some it can solve some equations that are solvable in in
     terms of the Lambert W function; some examples:

          (%i1) load(to_poly_solve)$

          (%i2) to_poly_solve(set(max(x,y) = 5, x+y = 2), set(x,y));
          (%o2)      %union([x = - 3, y = 5], [x = 5, y = - 3])

     For linear inequalities, `to_poly_solve' automatically does Fourier
     elimination:

          (%i8) to_poly_solve([x + y < 1, x - y >= 8], [x,y]);
                                         7
          (%o8) %union([x = y + 8, y < - -],
                                         2
                                                                        7
                                           [y + 8 < x, x < 1 - y, y < - -])

     Each optional argument to `to_poly_solve' must be an equation;
     generally, the order of these options does not matter.

        * `simpfuncs = l', where `l' is a list of functions.  Apply the
          composition of the members of l to each solution.

          (%i1) to_poly_solve(x^2=%i,x);

          Sometimes additional simplification can revert a
          simplification; for example

          (%o3)              %union([x = - 1], [x = 1])

          (%o4)            %union([x = 1], [x = %e      ]

          Maxima doesn't try to check that each member of the function
          list `l' is purely a simplification; thus

          (%i5) to_poly_solve(x^2 = %i,x, 'simpfuncs = [lambda([s],s^2)]);

                              'simpfuncs = ['dfloat]), algexact : true;

        * `use_grobner = true' With this option, the function

          (%o8)                       %union()

        * `maxdepth = k', where `k' is a positive integer.  This
          function controls the maximum recursion depth for the solver.
          The default value for `maxdepth' is five.  When the
          recursions depth is exceeded, the solver signals an error:

          (%i9) to_poly_solve(cos(x) = x,x, 'maxdepth = 2);

          Unable to solve
          Unable to solve
          (%o9)        %solve([cos(x) = x], [x], maxdepth = 2)

        * `parameters = l', where `l' is a list of symbols.  The solver
          attempts to return a solution that is valid for all members
          of the list `l'; for example:

          (%i10) to_poly_solve(a * x = x, x);
          (%o10)                   %union([x = 0])
          (%i11) to_poly_solve(a * x = x, x, 'parameters = [a]);
          (%o11) %union(%if(a - 1 = 0, [x = %c111], %union()),
                                         %if(a - 1 # 0, [x = 0], %union()))

          In `(%o2)', the solver introduced a dummy variable; to
          re-index the these dummy variables, use the function
          `nicedummies':

          (%i12) nicedummies(%);
          (%o12) %union(%if(a - 1 = 0, [x = %c0], %union()),
                                         %if(a - 1 # 0, [x = 0], %union()))

     The `to_poly_solve' uses data stored in the hashed array
     `one_to_one_reduce' to solve equations of the form f(a) = f(b).
     The assignment `one_to_one_reduce['f,'f] : lambda([a,b], a=b)'
     tells `to_poly_solve' that the solution set of f(a) = f(b) equals
     the solution set of a=b; for example

          (%i13) one_to_one_reduce['f,'f] : lambda([a,b], a=b)$

          (%i14) to_poly_solve(f(x^2-1) = f(0),x);
          (%o14)             %union([x = - 1], [x = 1])

     More generally, the assignment `one_to_one_reduce['f,'g] :
     lambda([a,b], w(a, b) = 0' tells `to_poly_solve' that the solution
     set of f(a) = f(b) equals the solution set of w(a,b) = 0; for
     example

          (%i15) one_to_one_reduce['f,'g] : lambda([a,b], a = 1 + b/2)$

          (%i16) to_poly_solve(f(x) - g(x),x);
          (%o16)                   %union([x = 2])

     Additionally, the function `to_poly_solve' uses data stored in the
     hashed array `function_inverse' to solve equations of the form
     f(a) = b.  The assignment `function_inverse['f] : lambda([s],
     g(s))' informs  `to_poly_solve' that the solution set to `f(x) =
     b' equals the solution set to `x = g(b)'; two examples:

          (%i17) function_inverse['Q] : lambda([s], P(s))$

          (%i18) to_poly_solve(Q(x-1) = 2009,x);
          (%o18)              %union([x = P(2009) + 1])
          (%i19) function_inverse['G] : lambda([s], s+new_variable(integer));
          (%o19)       lambda([s], s + new_variable(integer))
          (%i20) to_poly_solve(G(x - a) = b,x);
          (%o20)             %union([x = b + a + %z125])

     Notes

        * The solve variables needn't be symbols; when `fullratsubst' is
          able to appropriately make substitutions, the solve variables
          can be nonsymbols:

          (%i1) to_poly_solve([x^2 + y^2 + x * y = 5, x * y = 8],
                              [x^2 + y^2, x * y]);
                                            2    2
          (%o1)           %union([x y = 8, y  + x  = - 3])

        * For equations that involve complex conjugates, the solver
          automatically appends the conjugate equations; for example

          (%i1) declare(x,complex)$

          (%i2) to_poly_solve(x + (5 + %i) * conjugate(x) = 1, x);
                                             %i + 21
          (%o2)              %union([x = - -----------])
                                           25 %i - 125
          (%i3) declare(y,complex)$

          (%i4) to_poly_solve(set(conjugate(x) - y = 42 + %i,
                                  x + conjugate(y) = 0), set(x,y));
                                     %i - 42        %i + 42
          (%o4)        %union([x = - -------, y = - -------])
                                        2              2

        * For an equation that involves the absolute value function, the
          `to_poly_solve' consults the fact database to decide if the
          argument to the absolute value is complex valued.  When

          (%i1) to_poly_solve(abs(x) = 6, x);
          (%o1)              %union([x = - 6], [x = 6])
          (%i2) declare(z,complex)$

          (%i3) to_poly_solve(abs(z) = 6, z);
          (%o3) %union(%if((%c11 # 0) %and (%c11 conjugate(%c11) - 36 =
                                                 0), [z = %c11], %union()))

          This is the only situation that the solver consults the fact
          database.  If a solve variable is declared to be an integer,
          for example, `to_poly_solve' ignores this declaration.

79.1 Introduction to Units
==========================

The _unit_ package enables the user to convert between arbitrary units
and work with dimensions in equations. The functioning of this package
is radically different from the original Maxima units package - whereas
the original was a basic list of definitions, this package uses
rulesets to allow the user to chose, on a per dimension basis, what
unit final answers should be rendered in.  It will separate units
instead of intermixing them in the display, allowing the user to
readily identify the units associated with a particular answer.  It
will allow a user to simplify an expression to its fundamental Base
Units, as well as providing fine control over simplifying to derived
units.  Dimensional analysis is possible, and a variety of tools are
available to manage conversion and simplification options. In addition
to customizable automatic conversion, _units_ also provides a
traditional manual conversion option.

   Note - when unit conversions are inexact Maxima will make
approximations resulting in fractions. This is a consequence of the
techniques used to simplify units.  The messages warning of this type
of substitution are disabled by default in the case of units (normally
they are on) since this situation occurs frequently and the warnings
clutter the output.  (The existing state of ratprint is restored after
unit conversions, so user changes to that setting will be preserved
otherwise.)  If  the user needs this information for units, they can set
_unitverbose:on_ to reactivate the printing of warnings from the unit
conversion process.

   _unit_ is included in Maxima in the share/contrib/unit directory. It
obeys normal Maxima package loading conventions:

     (%i1) load("unit")$

   The WARNING messages are expected and not a cause for concern - they
indicate the _unit_ package is redefining functions already defined in
Maxima proper.  This is necessary in order to properly handle units.
The user should be aware that if other changes have been made to these
functions by other packages those changes will be overwritten by this
loading process.

   The _unit.mac_ file also loads a lisp file _unit-functions.lisp_
which contains the lisp functions needed for the package.

   Clifford Yapp is the primary author.  He has received valuable
assistance from Barton Willis of the University of Nebraska at Kearney
(UNK), Robert Dodier, and other intrepid folk of the Maxima mailing
list.

   There are probably lots of bugs.  Let me know.  `float' and `numer'
don't do what is expected.

   TODO : dimension functionality, handling of temperature, showabbr
and friends.  Show examples with addition of quantities containing
units.

79.2 Functions and Variables for Units
======================================

 -- Function: setunits (<list>)
     By default, the _unit_ package does not use any derived
     dimensions, but will convert all units to the seven fundamental
     dimensions using MKS units.
          (%i2) N;
                                               kg m
          (%o2)                                ----
                                                 2
                                                s
          (%i3) dyn;
                                             1      kg m
          (%o3)                           (------) (----)
                                           100000     2
                                                     s
          (%i4) g;
                                              1
          (%o4)                             (----) (kg)
                                             1000
          (%i5) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                            127        kg m
          (%o5)                       (-------------) (----)
                                       1800000000000     2
                                                        s

     In some cases this is the desired behavior.  If the user wishes to
     use other units, this is achieved with the `setunits' command:
          (%i6) setunits([centigram,inch,minute]);
          (%o6)                                done
          (%i7) N;
                                      1800000000000   %in cg
          (%o7)                      (-------------) (------)
                                           127            2
                                                      %min
          (%i8) dyn;
                                         18000000   %in cg
          (%o8)                         (--------) (------)
                                           127          2
                                                    %min
          (%i9) g;
          (%o9)                             (100) (cg)
          (%i10) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                              %in cg
          (%o10)                              ------
                                                  2
                                              %min

     The setting of units is quite flexible.  For example, if we want to
     get back to kilograms, meters, and seconds as defaults for those
     dimensions we can do:
          (%i11) setunits([kg,m,s]);
          (%o11)                               done
          (%i12) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                            127        kg m
          (%o12)                      (-------------) (----)
                                       1800000000000     2
                                                        s

     Derived units are also handled by this command:
          (%i17) setunits(N);
          (%o17)                               done
          (%i18) N;
          (%o18)                                 N
          (%i19) dyn;
                                              1
          (%o19)                           (------) (N)
                                            100000
          (%i20) kg*m/s^2;
          (%o20)                                 N
          (%i21) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                              127
          (%o21)                        (-------------) (N)
                                         1800000000000

     Notice that the _unit_ package recognized the non MKS combination
     of mass, length, and inverse time squared as a force, and
     converted it to Newtons.  This is how Maxima works in general.
     If, for example, we prefer dyne to Newtons, we simply do the
     following:
          (%i22) setunits(dyn);
          (%o22)                               done
          (%i23) kg*m/s^2;
          (%o23)                          (100000) (dyn)
          (%i24) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                            127
          (%o24)                         (--------) (dyn)
                                          18000000

     To discontinue simplifying to any force, we use the uforget
     command:
          (%i26) uforget(dyn);
          (%o26)                               false
          (%i27) kg*m/s^2;
                                               kg m
          (%o27)                               ----
                                                 2
                                                s
          (%i28) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                            127        kg m
          (%o28)                      (-------------) (----)
                                       1800000000000     2
                                                        s
     This would have worked equally well with `uforget(N)' or
     `uforget(%force)'.

     See also `uforget'. To use this function write first
     `load("unit")'.


 -- Function: uforget (<list>)
     By default, the _unit_ package converts all units to the seven
     fundamental dimensions using MKS units. This behavior can be
     changed with the `setunits' command. After that, the user can
     restore the default behavior for a particular dimension by means
     of the `uforget' command:
          (%i13) setunits([centigram,inch,minute]);
          (%o13)                               done
          (%i14) centigram*inch/minutes^2;
                                              %in cg

     `uforget' operates on dimensions, not units, so any unit of a
     particular dimension will work.  The dimension itself is also a
     legal argument.

     See also `setunits'. To use this function write first
     `load("unit")'.


 -- Function: convert (<expr>, <list>)
     When resetting the global environment is overkill, there is the
     `convert' command, which allows one time conversions.  It can
     accept either a single argument or a list of units to use in
     conversion.  When a convert operation is done, the normal global
     evaluation system is bypassed, in order to avoid the desired
     result being converted again.  As a consequence, for inexact
     calculations "rat" warnings will be visible if the global
     environment controlling this behavior (`ratprint') is true.  This
     is also useful for spot-checking the accuracy of a global
     conversion.  Another feature is `convert' will allow a user to do
     Base Dimension conversions even if the global environment is set to
     simplify to a Derived Dimension.

 -- Optional variable: usersetunits
     Default value: none

     If a user wishes to have a default unit behavior other than that
     described, they can make use of _maxima-init.mac_ and the
     _usersetunits_ variable.  The _unit_ package will check on startup
     to see if this variable has been assigned a list.  If it has, it
     will use setunits on that list and take the units from that list
     to be defaults.  `uforget' will revert to the behavior defined by
     usersetunits over its own defaults.  For example, if we have a
     _maxima-init.mac_ file containing:
          usersetunits : [N,J];
     we would see the following behavior:
          (%i1) load("unit")$

     Without `usersetunits', the initial inputs would have been
     converted to MKS, and uforget would have resulted in a return to
     MKS rules.  Instead, the user preferences are respected in both
     cases.  Notice these can still be overridden if desired.  To
     completely eliminate this simplification - i.e.  to have the user
     defaults reset to factory defaults - the `dontusedimension'
     command can be used.  `uforget' can restore user settings again,
     but only if `usedimension' frees it for use.  Alternately,
     `kill(usersetunits)' will completely remove all knowledge of the
     user defaults from the session.  Here are some examples of how
     these various options work.

     Unfortunately this wide variety of options is a little confusing
     at first, but once the user grows used to them they should find
     they have very full control over their working environment.


 -- Function: metricexpandall (<x>)
     Rebuilds global unit lists automatically creating all desired
     metric units.  <x> is a numerical argument which is used to
     specify how many metric prefixes the user wishes defined.  The
     arguments are as follows, with each higher number defining all
     lower numbers' units:
                     0 - none. Only base units
                     1 - kilo, centi, milli
          (default)  2 - giga, mega, kilo, hecto, deka, deci, centi, milli,
                         micro, nano
                     3 - peta, tera, giga, mega, kilo, hecto, deka, deci,
                         centi, milli, micro, nano, pico, femto
                     4 - all
     Normally, Maxima will not define the full expansion since this
     results in a very large number of units, but `metricexpandall' can
     be used to rebuild the list in a more or less complete fashion.
     The relevant variable in the _unit.mac_ file is <%unitexpand>.


 -- Variable: %unitexpand
     Default value: `2'

     This is the value supplied to `metricexpandall' during the initial
     loading of _unit_.

80.1 Introduction to zeilberger
===============================

`zeilberger' is a implementation of Zeilberger's algorithm for definite
hypergeometric summation, and also Gosper's algorithm for indefinite
hypergeometric summation.

   `zeilberger' makes use of the "filtering" optimization method
developed by Axel Riese.

   `zeilberger' was developed by Fabrizio Caruso.

   `load (zeilberger)' loads this package.

80.1.0.1 The indefinite summation problem
.........................................

`zeilberger' implements Gosper's algorithm for indefinite
hypergeometric summation.  Given a hypergeometric term F_k in k we want
to find its hypergeometric anti-difference, that is, a hypergeometric
term f_k such that

   F_k = f_(k+1) - f_k.

80.1.0.2 The definite summation problem
.......................................

`zeilberger' implements Zeilberger's algorithm for definite
hypergeometric summation.  Given a proper hypergeometric term (in n and
k) F_(n,k) and a positive integer d we want to find a d-th order linear
recurrence with polynomial coefficients (in n) for F_(n,k) and a
rational function R in n and k such that

   a_0 F_(n,k) + ... + a_d F_(n+d),k = Delta_k(R(n,k) F_(n,k)),

   where Delta_k is the k-forward difference operator, i.e.,
Delta_k(t_k) := t_(k+1) - t_k.

80.1.1 Verbosity levels
-----------------------

There are also verbose versions of the commands which are called by
adding one of the following prefixes:

`Summary'
     Just a summary at the end is shown

`Verbose'
     Some information in the intermidiate steps

`VeryVerbose'
     More information

`Extra'
     Even more information including information on the linear system
     in Zeilberger's algorithm

   For example:
`GosperVerbose', `parGosperVeryVerbose', `ZeilbergerExtra',
`AntiDifferenceSummary'.

80.2 Functions and Variables for zeilberger
===========================================

 -- Function: AntiDifference (F_k, <k>)
     Returns the hypergeometric anti-difference of F_k, if it exists.
     Otherwise `AntiDifference' returns `no_hyp_antidifference'.


 -- Function: Gosper (F_k, <k>)
     Returns the rational certificate R(k) for F_k, that is, a rational
     function such that F_k = R(k+1) F_(k+1) - R(k) F_k, if it exists.
     Otherwise, `Gosper' returns `no_hyp_sol'.


 -- Function: GosperSum (F_k, <k>, <a>, <b>)
     Returns the summmation of F_k from <k> = <a> to <k> = <b> if F_k
     has a hypergeometric anti-difference.  Otherwise, `GosperSum'
     returns `nongosper_summable'.

          (%o8)                  NON_GOSPER_SUMMABLE


 -- Function: parGosper (F_(n,k), <k>, <n>, <d>)
     Attempts to find a <d>-th order recurrence for F_(n,k).

     The algorithm yields a sequence [s_1, s_2, ..., s_m] of solutions.
     Each solution has the form

     [R(n, k), [a_0, a_1, ..., a_d]].

     `parGosper' returns `[]' if it fails to find a recurrence.


 -- Function: Zeilberger (F_(n,k), <k>, <n>)
     Attempts to compute the indefinite hypergeometric summation of
     F_(n,k).

     `Zeilberger' first invokes `Gosper', and if that fails to find a
     solution, then invokes `parGosper' with order 1, 2, 3, ..., up to
     `MAX_ORD'.  If Zeilberger finds a solution before reaching
     `MAX_ORD', it stops and returns the solution.

     The algorithms yields a sequence [s_1, s_2, ..., s_m] of solutions.
     Each solution has the form

     [R(n,k), [a_0, a_1, ..., a_d]].

     `Zeilberger' returns `[]' if it fails to find a solution.

     `Zeilberger' invokes `Gosper' only if `Gosper_in_Zeilberger' is
     `true'.


80.3 General global variables
=============================

 -- Global variable: MAX_ORD
     Default value: 5

     `MAX_ORD' is the maximum recurrence order attempted by
     `Zeilberger'.


 -- Global variable: simplified_output
     Default value: `false'

     When `simplified_output' is `true', functions in the `zeilberger'
     package attempt further simplification of the solution.


 -- Global variable: linear_solver
     Default value: `linsolve'

     `linear_solver' names the solver which is used to solve the system
     of equations in Zeilberger's algorithm.


 -- Global variable: warnings
     Default value: `true'

     When `warnings' is `true', functions in the `zeilberger' package
     print warning messages during execution.


 -- Global variable: Gosper_in_Zeilberger
     Default value: `true'

     When `Gosper_in_Zeilberger' is `true', the `Zeilberger' function
     calls `Gosper' before calling `parGosper'.  Otherwise,
     `Zeilberger' goes immediately to `parGosper'.


 -- Global variable: trivial_solutions
     Default value: `true'

     When `trivial_solutions' is `true', `Zeilberger' returns solutions
     which have certificate equal to zero, or all coefficients equal to
     zero.


80.4 Variables related to the modular test
==========================================

 -- Global variable: mod_test
     Default value: `false'

     When `mod_test' is `true', `parGosper' executes a modular test for
     discarding systems with no solutions.


 -- Global variable: modular_linear_solver
     Default value: `linsolve'

     `modular_linear_solver' names the linear solver used by the
     modular test in `parGosper'.


 -- Global variable: ev_point
     Default value: `big_primes[10]'

     `ev_point' is the value at which the variable <n> is evaluated
     when executing the modular test in `parGosper'.


 -- Global variable: mod_big_prime
     Default value: `big_primes[1]'

     `mod_big_prime' is the modulus used by the modular test in
     `parGosper'.


 -- Global variable: mod_threshold
     Default value: 4

     `mod_threshold' is the greatest order for which the modular test
     in `parGosper' is attempted.
