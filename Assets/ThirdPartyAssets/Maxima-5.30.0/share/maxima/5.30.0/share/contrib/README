 Code in this directory is considered external to the
 main Maxima distribution, and is not supported by
 the main Maxima team.  If you need help with one of
 the packages here, your best bet is to contact the
 author.  If the status of a package present here 
 changes to supported, it will be moved into the 
 regular share directory.

                Zeilberger's algorithm for definite hypergeometric 
		summation and Gosper's algorithm for indefinite 
		hypergeometric summation.

		package from http://www.telefonica.net/web2/biomates/

distrib/        Mario Rodriguez Riotorto's probability distributions
		package from http://www.telefonica.net/web2/biomates/

diffequations/  This directory contains additional methods for
		solving ordinary differential equations. Written
		by David Billinghurst.
