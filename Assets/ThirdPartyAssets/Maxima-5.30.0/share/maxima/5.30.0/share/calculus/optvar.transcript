(C6) /* This macsyma batch file illustrates how to use the
functions in OPTVAR > or OPTVAR LISP to help solve classical
variational or optimal control problems.  These functions
use the calculus of variations and Pontryagin's
Maximum-Principle to derive the governing differential and
algebraic equations; and this demonstration also shows how
the governing equations may be solved using the built-in
SOLVE function and/or the functions in the SHARE files  ODER
LISP, and DESOLN LISP.  For more details, see the
corresponding SHARE text files OPTVAR USAGE, ODER USAGE, or
DESOLN USAGE.

The illustrative examples here are intentionally elementary.
For a more thorough discussion of the mathematical
principles demonstrated here, and for results with more
difficult examples, see the the ALOHA project technical
report by David Stoutemyer, "Computer algebraic manipulation
for the calculus of variations, the maximum principle, and
automatic control", University of Hawaii, 1974.

Many classical variational problems are analagous to special
cases of choosing a path which minimizes the transit time
through a region for which the speed is a function of
position.  There are applications in, optics, acoustics,
hydrodynamics, and routing of aircraft or ships. In the
two-dimensional case, assuming the path may be represented
by a single-valued function, Y(X), the transit time between
Y(A) and Y(B) is given by the integral of
Q(X,Y)*SQRT(1+'D(y,x)**2), from X=A to X=B, where D is an
alias for DIFF and Q(X,Y) is the reciprocal of the speed,
and where we have used the fact that 'D(arclength,X) =
SQRT(1+'D(Y,X)**2).  For simplicity, assume Q independent of
X.  We may use the function EL, previously loaded by
LOADFILE(OPTVAR,LISP,DSK, SHARE), to derive the associated
Euler-Lagrange equation together with an associated energy
and/or momentum integral if they exist: */

(C16) /* This equation may be simplified by combining the
LOGs and clearing some fractions, but it is transcendental
in Y; so there is no hope for a closed-form representation
for Y(X).  For completeness we should try the other
alternative for 'D(Y,X), but it turns out to lead to the
same result.

Most authors solve this problem by introducing the change of
variable 'D(Y,X)=TAN(T), useful also for other Q(Y), which
leads to the para- metric representation: Y=K[0]*COS(T)**2,
X=C+K[0]*(T+SIN(T)*COS(T)). Solving the former for T and
substituting into the latter gives the representation
equivalent to that found directly by macsyma.

Some straightforward investigation reveals that  C  is the
initial value of  X,  but the equation is transcendental in
K[0], so K[0] cannot be determined analytically.  However,
it may be determined to arbitrary numerical accuracy by an
iterative algorithm such as that described in the SHARE file
ZEROIN USAGE.

To prove that the above solution is a strong global minimum,
we must prove that such a minimum exists and that no other
answer gives a smaller value to the functional.  This may be
done by the direct approach of Caratheodory,  or by checking
the classical Weierstrass, Weierstrass-Erdman, Legendre, and
and Jacobi necessary and sufficient conditions.  Computer
algebraic manipulation can assist these investigations, but
they are beyond the scope of this demonstration.  Instead,
to keep the demonstration brief, we will now consider other
kinds of problems.

Stationary values of a functional may be subject to
algebraic or differential constraints of the form
F(X,Y(X),'D(Y,X))=0 and/or isoperimetric constraints of the
form INTEGRATE(F(X,Y(X),'D(Y,X)),X,A,B) = J, where J is a
given constant. Sometimes it is possible to eliminate one or
more constraints, substituting them into the functional and
any remaining constraints; but if not, we may use Lagrange
multipliers.  For example, suppose we wish to determine the
curve that a string of given length assumes to minimize its
potential energy.  The potential energy is 
INTEGRATE(Y*SQRT(1+'D(Y,X)**2), X, A, B), whereas the length
is INTEGRATE(SQRT(1+'D(Y,X)**2), X, A, B); so letting MULT
be the Lagrange multiplier, our augmented functional is of
the form that we have been studying, with Q(Y)=Y+MULT.
Consequently, we may simply substitute this in the general
integral that we found before: */

Many variational optimization problems are easier to treat

problems.

As an elementary example, suppose that we have a unit mass
at an arbitrary position X[0] with arbitrary velocity V[0]
at time T=0, and we wish to vary the force  F, subject to
the constraint -1 <= F <= 1, such that the mass arrives at
position X=0 with velocity V=0, in minimum time.  The force
equals the rate of change of momentum; so the motion is
governed by the pair of first-order differential equations:
