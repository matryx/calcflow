(C36) /* The limitations of STAP are primarily dependent upon the
limitations of the macsyma SOLVE command for solving nonlinear
equations.  SOLVE will attempt to find a closed-form solution to a
single equation that is irrational or involves elementary
transcendental functions; but as of June 1974, SOLVE is intended
to solve simultaneous equations only if they are polynomial
in the unknowns.  However, it generally converts rational equations
to this form by multiplying each equation by the least common
denominator of its terms; so it may solve simultaneous rational
equations too.  Thus, as in our first two examples, the objective may
contain any terms with rational gradients, such as ATAN(R), ATANH(R),
or LOG(R), where R is rational in the decision variables.  The clearing
of the denominator may result in a "solution" which is a pole for some
gradient components while a zero for the others.  Although not a true
solution to the equations, this is a bonus in our case, because we are 
interested in all extrema, not just stationary points.  In fact, we
are usually more interested in any poles of the proper sign than in
stationary points of the proper type with finite objective values.
Poles, if found, are usually revealed in an alarming way by one or
more large-magnitude components in GRADSUB or OBJSUB, or by an error
interrupt such as a zerodivide.

A surprising number of optimization problems can be converted to the
required form by a change of variable  For example, fractional powers
of a decision variable, X, may be eliminated by letting X = Z**Q,
where Q is the least common denominator of the fractional powers of x.

Now let's try the famous post-office parcel problem:  maximize the
volume of a rectangular parallelopiped parcel, subject to the
constraints that the length plus the girth can't exceed 72,
and that the length, width, and depth cannot be negative or 
exceed 42.  With three decision variables and 7 inequality constraints,
a direct approach using STAP would involve 17 simultaneous nonlinear
equations, which is beyond its present capabilities.  However, since we
are only interested in stationary points that are maxima, it is clear
that none of the non-negativity constraints will be active, and the
length-plus-girth constraint will be active.  Knowing this, we may
treat the length-plus-girth constraint as an equality, thus avoiding 
one slack variable; and we may ignore the non-negativity constraints,
rejecting any negative solutions, avoiding three multipliers and three
more slacks.  Moreover, neither the width nor depth can be 42, because
then the girth alone would exceed 72; so we may ignore these
constraints to avoid two more slacks and two more multipliers.  These
simplifications result in a simple enough system of 6 simultaneous
nonlinear equations to be solved by SOLVE in a reasonable amount
of time: */

(C97) /* It is almost always worth solving the largest possible subset
of the equality constraints for variables that enter them linearly,
then using this solution to eliminate these variables from the
remaining constraints and from the objective.  This is also worth
doing for variables that enter nonlinearly, provided it introduces no
fractional powers in the objective or remaining constraints.
For example, to find the stationary points of  X + 3*Y - 6*Z**2,
subject to  X**2 + Y**2 + Z**2 = 1, it is well worth eliminating Z.

The change of variable for eliminating the inequality constraint
L <= 42, is equivalent to converting the inequality to an equality by
introducing a squared slack variable, solving for L, then eliminating
L from VOLSUB.  From this viewpoint, the "change of variable"
technique is seen to be applicable to a great variety of inequality
constraints, not merely upper and lower bounds as is implied in most
textbooks.  Together with applicable equality constraints, it is
generally worth including in the elimination the largest possible
subset of inequality constraints for which the eliminated variables
enter linearly, up to the number of decision variables minus the number
of equality constraints.

Another technique for treating an inequality constraint is to
solve the problem with the constraint assumed active, and also with
the constraint ignored, checking any stationary points for violation
of the constraint in the latter case: */

(C124) /*  GRAD is a global varible bound by STAP to the
symbolic expression for the gradient, and DECSLKMULTS is bound to the
variables that the gradient is taken with respect to, in the order
of their components in GRAD.  Thus, -405/4 points in, making the
point a saddle.

The report referenced at the beginning of this demonstration
explains how to generalize this test to more than one constraint.

When there is more than one inequality constraint, each feasible
combination must be activated, unless some additional convexity
requirements are satisfied.  Nevertheless, this combinatorial
activation technique is probably capable of treating
larger problems than either the change-of-variable or the squared-
slack-variable-with-multiplier techniques of treating inequality 
constraints. 

We have already seen how STAP finds poles of the objective or gradient
only by accident.  The following examples are included as reminders
about other limitations of using calculus to find extrema:*/

STAP(X, [], X**3-Y**2) $

(E124)                   NO STATIONARY POINTS FOUND
TIME= 4727 MSEC.

(C125) /* Lagrange multipliers require the constraints to have con-
tinuous tangents, and this is violated for the above example at X=0,
Y=0, where the objective is a minimum.  A direct use of elimination
would fail too, because it results in an undefined derivative at the
minimum.  In such cases, each piece between discontinuities must be
considered a separate constraint.

The next example has a minimum at X=0, Y=0, where the two
active constraints are parallel, making them linearly dependent.
Such cusps or "wiskers" on the feasible region violate the so-called
"constraint-qualification" requirement; so the extremum is not found:*/

STAP(X, [-Y, Y-X**3]) $

(E125)                   NO STATIONARY POINTS FOUND
TIME= 17706 MSEC.

(C126) /* The following example doesn't have a strictly feasible point;
so it violates Slater's condition; and the extremum at X=0 is not
found: */

STAP(X, X**2) $

(E126)                   NO STATIONARY POINTS FOUND
TIME= 4668 MSEC.

(C127) /* Finally, it is important to remember that unbounded regions
may have nonstationary or asymptotically stationary points
at infinity, which STAP will not find.  Such situations are usually
obvious from qualitative considerations, provided the objective and
constraints are not too complicated and numerous, but the macsyma LIMIT
function can be of help.  However, it is important to remember that a
multivariate limit depends upon the way it is taken.  This is
illustrated by the following example, where you will have to type
