    Converted to C# 27-02-13 - no credit wanted.
    Simple flycam I made, since I couldn't find any others made public.  
    Made simple to use (drag and drop, done) for regular keyboard layout  
    wasd : basic movement
    shift : Makes camera accelerate
    space : Moves camera on X and Z axis only.  So camera doesn't gain any height*/
